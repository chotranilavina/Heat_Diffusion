# Heat_Diffusion
Solve the unsteady heat diffusion equation on a square domain [0,1] x [0,1] with an initial temperature distribution T(t=0, x, y) = {40 C, if (x-0.5)^2+(y-0.5)^2 &lt; 0.2; 20 C otherwise}. The boundaries are maintained at 20 C all the time. First choose a discretization scheme (FD or FV or FE) and write the discrete heat equation. In case of FD, identify the order of the scheme, FV identify the control volume and for if using FE, write the weak form
